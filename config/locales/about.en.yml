          data_source:
            q: What is the source of the data?
            a: "The data is scraped from the official website at the following URL:"
          terms_of_use:
            q: Does this tool violate Buckler/Capcom's terms of use?
            a: Maybe yes, maybe no. It depends on how the terms are interpreted.<br>
               What I can say is that the site has been online since May 2024, and my email isn't hard to find.<br>
               In fact, I even sent an email to Capcom with the link to the tool, asking for a job (but unfortunately, I was rejected).<br>
               So, they definitely know it exists, and I would take it down if they asked.
          old_matches:
            q: Why can’t I see my old matches?
            a: The page above only provides data for the most recent 100 matches.
          im_sure:
            q: I’m pretty sure I recently played some matches with ... Why can’t I see them here?
            a: Check your profile on the official website. If the match is not listed there, it will not appear here either.
               If the match is listed on the official website but is missing here, please let me know %{email}.
